Description: The "HYDRAULIC VALVE" is used to control the flow and direction of hydraulic fluid within a hydraulic system. It regulates the pressure, flow rate, and direction of hydraulic fluid to perform various functions such as actuating cylinders, controlling motors, and operating hydraulic machinery. Tags: [hydraulic, fluid, flow control, pressure].

Description: The "DRUM MOTOR Ã˜80X343MM 0.07KW" is used for conveyor belt systems. It belongs to the class of motorized drum systems or conveyor drive systems, which play a crucial role in the transportation of materials in various industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing. Tags: [belt, conveyor, drum roller, motorized system].

Description: The "SENSOR" is used to detect the presence or conditions in the environment. It is a critical component that regulates the operation of machines and systems across different industries. Tags: [sense, detection, movement, object].
