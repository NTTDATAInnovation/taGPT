# NDBS TaGPT
NDBS TagGPT is a WIP auto-label solution for NDBS. It is based on the paper [TagGPT: Large Language Models are Zero-shot Multimodal Taggers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03022) and the related TagGPT source code - Although 95% have changed.


## ðŸ”§ Dependencies
See requirements.txt for details.

```bash
# after setting up a virtual environment
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### Help
Run the following command to get help on arguments:
```bash
python main.py --help
```

### Config
